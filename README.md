# AdventureWorks SQL Queries ðŸ“Š

This repository contains a series of SQL queries designed to explore and analyze the AdventureWorks database. Each query targets a specific business question or transformation challenge, ranging from filtering and sorting data, joining multiple tables, to applying logic for segmentation and financial computations.

## ðŸ§  Query Descriptions

### 1. Filter Products by Color and Price
We filter out products whose colors are null, red, silver/black, or white, and only keep those within a price range of Â£75 to Â£750. We rename `StandardCost` to `price` for clarity, and sort the results by price descending.

### 2. Select Employees by Gender, Birth Year, and Hire Date
This query retrieves:
- Male employees born between 1962 and 1970, hired after 2001
- Female employees born between 1972 and 1975, hired between 2001 and 2002

### 3. Top 10 Most Expensive â€˜BKâ€™ Products
Lists the top 10 products whose product numbers start with â€˜BKâ€™, showing product ID, name, color, and price.

### 4. Contact Match Logic
Retrieves contacts where:
- The first four letters of the last name match the first four of the email
- The first letter of the first name equals the first letter of the last name
It then creates a full name column and calculates its length.

### 5. Subcategories with Long Manufacturing Time
Returns product subcategories whose average manufacturing time is 3 days or more.

### 6. Product Price Segmentation
Segments products based on their price range:
- <Â£200: Low Value
- Â£201â€“Â£750: Mid Value
- Â£751â€“Â£1250: Mid to High Value
- >Â£1250: Higher Value
Only applies to black, silver, and red products.

### 7. Count of Unique Job Titles
Simple query to count the number of distinct job titles in the employee table.

### 8. Calculate Employee Age at Hire
Finds the age of each employee at the time they were hired.

### 9. Long Service Award Eligibility
Calculates how many employees will complete 20 years of service within the next 5 years.

### 10. Years Left Until Sentiment

### 11. New Pricing Policy Based on Color
Implements a pricing strategy:
- White: +8%
- Yellow: âˆ’7.5%

Also calculates a 37.5% commission on the new price.
